ÿßFirst off i want to say that this is my 
first prog. Personally I think that it isn't 
that good compared to some of the 
other progz on AOL. But it has all the 
things you need.

I wasn't even really trying to make a 
serious prog. I just started to see 
what I could do and this is how it 
turned out. I'm not even going to try to 
make Fatal Fury 2.0. This took way to 
long. 

After this i'm gonna try to actually 
make something useful. I want to 
learn C++. But for now I'm sticking 
with VB.

Another thing i wanted to say is that I 
don't get why programmers say that 
AOL sucks so much. If you hate it so 
much then why do u devote yourself to 
making progz for its users!

Thats about it.
